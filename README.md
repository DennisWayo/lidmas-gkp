## LiDMaS

LiDMaS is a lightweight, architecture-level simulator for investigating logical magic-state injection
in Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP)–encoded photonic qubits. The framework models finite squeezing,
logical Pauli noise, and photon-loss-induced erasure using density matrices, enabling rapid exploration
of fault-tolerant design trade-offs without continuous-variable wavefunction simulation or decoder-level modeling.
